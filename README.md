===================

Chapin Hall's tagline is "Policy research that benefits children, families, and their communities". One of the greatest public sources of data on children, families and their communities is the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/). From the ACS 1-year data which enables comparisons from year-to-year on regional summaries and changes to the ACS 5-year data which enables geographically granular focus, this is one of the most useful resources for Chapin Hall researchers to have handy.

This project has established to help us all work together--from researcher to researcher, and project to project--so that our work cumulates and accelerates.

### Main Features
The main features of this project are:
1. Programming scripts to facilite custom download, extraction, and selection of data for custom data sets, geographies and tables
2. Programming scripts to generate secondary constructions from the data, e.g. calculation of % of families under the poverty line (whereas the ACS only has # of families below the poverty line, and # of families)
3. Programming scripts and or applications to create custom tables, maps, or other visualizations of these data.

A secondary feature of this project is a preference for open source tools such as R or Python which can allow us to make this project a maximally effective open source project in the future, if desired.

### Related Projects

This project is a cousin to the [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org/) project supported by the Knight Foundation, and led by a team of web developers at the Knight Lab at Northwestern ([blog for the project](http://censusreporter.tumblr.com/)). Whereas that project is focused around interactive generation of Census data visuals for reporters, as researchers we need easy access to processed data as an input into other research projects.
